Hi!
I'm a a CTO, consultant, and have been a full-stack developer since the 90s. I'm an author of multiple articles showing a creative approach to using Ruby on Rails. Currently, I'm excited about AI's potential and cross-tech discoveries. I'm a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups and a big supporter of the European Ruby scene. I build games for fun.
